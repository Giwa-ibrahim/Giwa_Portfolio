## About Me
I am a recent graduate of Ladoke Akintola University of Technology (LAUTECH), where I studied Electronic and Electrical Engineering. With less than one year of experience in the Data Science field, I have undertaken several professional courses covering the basics of Data Analytics and Machine Learning. To date, I have successfully completed two projects related to Renewable Energy, which align with my field of study.

#[Project 1: Wind Speed Prediction using LSTM Model](https://github.com/Giwa-ibrahim/Giwa_Portfolio/blob/main/Wind_Speed_Prediction_Model.ipynb)

This is a project I did for my Undergraduate Final year project.

**Project Overview
* Data was collected from the Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NIMET) and contained 10 years (20) wind speed from Kano state, Nigeria.
* Preprocessing steps such as Data cleaning and feature engineering were done.
* LSTM, ANN, GRU, and SimpleRNN models were used to train the models where LSTM outperformed other models based on the error metrics.
*  The LSTM hyperparameters such as the number of neurons, layers, timesteps, number of engineered features, otimizers, etc,  was iterated to optimize the accuracy of the model and was finally compared with other neural network variants.
